This is even more true when you consider that many gyms around the country are currently closed due to the pandemic, which leaves you with&nbsp;outdoor workouts&nbsp;during the coldest weather season. The very thought makes us want to pour a cup of hot cocoa and settle into the couch.&nbsp;But, it goes without saying that the benefits of regular exercise far outweigh the inconvenience of cold weather. Regular workouts will&nbsp;improve your mood&nbsp;(key during winter\u2019s decreased daylight), increase your energy levels, and help you get a&nbsp;better night\u2019s sleep. So we\u2019ve put together a winter primer for how to stay active during the cold weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>UNDERSTAND THE WHY<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re only at the start of winter. If you\u2019ve already seen your activity level plummet, it\u2019s important to know that\u2019s normal. \u201cDuring colder months, we tend to spend less time being active and focusing on self-care,\u201d says Osayi Osunde, owner of Philadelphia-based&nbsp;Fit Academy. \u201cPlus, this time of year is full of back-to-back national holidays and social get-togethers. It\u2019s all bound to lead to a few extra pounds.\u201d&nbsp;Adding insult to injury, we\u2019re also in that time of year when sunlight is at a minimum. \u201cNot only does it get darker sooner, but we tend to hunch forward against the wind and cold, which creates a defensive posture,\u201d says yoga teacher and partner at New York-based&nbsp;NY Love Yoga&nbsp;MJ Watkins<strong>.<\/strong>&nbsp;\u201cWhen the seasons change, so do our bodies.\u201d&nbsp;This means it\u2019s that much harder (and more important) to stay active when the temperatures drop. \u201cWhen our bodies adjust to cold weather, things contract,\u201d says New York-based personal trainer Lucas Hall. \u201cAny tightness we already have in our muscles gets amplified. Movement is so important to help loosen stiff joints and help the mind stay sharp.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>CARVE OUT TIME<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any movement is better than no movement. If you\u2019ve only got twenty minutes, make sure to make those minutes count with a circuit that hits most of the main muscle groups. Osunde recommends doing four rounds of the below:&nbsp;\u25cf Push-up to toe touch\u25cf Squat + curl + shoulder press (using resistance bands or dumbbells)\u25cf Bear crawls\u25cf 180 squat jumps\u25cf Reverse lunge + row (using resistance bands or dumbbells)&nbsp;For at-home yoga practice, Watkins suggests starting with a quick walk around your home using opposite arms and opposite legs, which she says will cross your energy patterns. \u201cMake sure to use deep diaphragm breathing, too, to bring the body, mind, and energy together,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\u201cIn the winter, everything slows down and our bodies want to rest,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s important to honor that you might not want to do that super active class, and instead opt for something slower and more restorative.\u201d For a nice blend of movement on the mat, Hall suggests the below for a quick yoga series:&nbsp;\u25cf 10 minutes of sun salutations\u25cf Hold plank for 1 minute\u25cf Hold cobra for 1 minute\u25cf Side planks on each side&nbsp;\u25cf Low crescent lunge on each side\u25cf Pyramid pose on each side\u25cf Relax for 2 minutes, focusing on your breath&nbsp;When it comes to gear that can battle the elements, think lightweight, layering&nbsp;hoodies&nbsp;and&nbsp;leggings&nbsp;that keep you both warm and dry in&nbsp;cold weather&nbsp;conditions. Osunde also recommends investing in a set of portable resistance bands to use both&nbsp;indoors&nbsp;or outdoors. This kind of portable fitness equipment makes it more convenient to get in a workout wherever you are. \u201cI also love a percussive device, or massager, to help loosen the fascia, increase blood flow and increase mobility,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll warm up faster in cold weather and it helps&nbsp;muscles recover&nbsp;while you\u2019re relaxing at home afterward.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter is just getting started and it\u2019s only natural that your fitness routine (and your motivation) might take a hit.
